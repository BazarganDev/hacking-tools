## Tools
- Port Scanner
	- V1: Fast but not powerful enough (could miss some ports)
	- V2: Powerful but not fast enough (could take a long time)

## How To Run
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/BazarganDev/hacking-tools.git`
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script: `python SCRIPT_NAME.py`

## Where To Scan?
Since scanning ports on a host without a permission or authority is illegal in most cases, I recommend you to create a simple web server on your localhost with Python. Just go to the directory you want and create a HTTP server:<br>
```
~ cd DIRECTORY/FOR/CREATING/SERVER/
~ python -m http.server 8080
```
Now you can go to `http://localhost:8080` to check out your server. Now you can perform your hacking attempts on the localhost to avoid your IP being blacklisted on the internet or any other legal issues. üôÇ

## ToDo
- [ ] Add a DDoS script
